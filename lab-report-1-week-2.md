## Remotely Connecting
---
1) Launch VSCode.  Navigate to Terminal and click “Create a New Terminal”.  Type in cs15lsp22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu into the terminal.  The terminal will prompt you for a password and you will need to either reset your old password (if it doesn’t work) or use the one you already set.

   Note: zz are placeholders, you have a unique combination of letters that should replace the zz.  You can find your account on TritonLink Account Finder.  To find the letters go to https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php and look for a CS 15L account.
